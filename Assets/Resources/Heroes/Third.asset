  m_strName: 'The Healer: Elira Dawnveil'
  m_strDescr: Elira is a healer, she inherited it from her inborn healers and she
    can also perform heal by channel. For instance after the death of her brother
    in a war, she was determined to build strength in order to work for the side
    of life as opposed to allowing other people go through the same kind of hurt
    that she was enduring. She set herself on a task as finding the old phoenix feather
    which is capable of bringing the dead back to life.
